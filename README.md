# RDA_in_Python
This is the Receptor Density Algorithm (RDA) implemented in Python 2.7. RDA is an Artificial Immune System (AIS) anomaly detection algorithm modelled upon how T-cell receptors respond to antigen, originally modelled by Owens et al in 2009. This was part of a sub-project to investigate its applicability as an AIS anomaly classifier for our self-healing architecture.
